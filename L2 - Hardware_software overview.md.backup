# Levels of abstraction
![[Pasted image 20240301104624.png]]

Hardware is controlled by manipulating value of registers. 
1000 of registers so put together sdks - abstract to function


# Internal Hardware
**Datasheets**
![[Pasted image 20240301105655.png]]

**2 Processors** (Proc0 and Proc1)
which are connected to SIO


**SIO** - single cycle io
Peripheral that cpus need low latency access to. 1 Cycle

Hardware spin locks. can lock out from other cpu.

**DMA**
32 bit transcation per cpu cycle

RP2040 runs at 125Mz but you could try to over clock thing to 200Mz or 300 - 350Mz

**Memory**
SRAM organised in 6 blocks
ROM boot loader


**POI**
Can write Assembly to directly manipulate the GIPOs

# Mapping internal signals to GPIO

For example GP0 could be 
- RX pin for SPI channel 0
- Data pin for I2C channel 0
- TX pin for UARTO channel 0
